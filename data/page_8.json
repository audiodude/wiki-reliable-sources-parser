There is consensus that Xinhua is generally reliable for factual reporting except in areas where the government of China may have a reason to use it for propaganda or disinformation. Xinhua is also generally reliable for the views and positions of the Chinese government and its officials. For subjects where the Chinese government may be a stakeholder, the consensus is almost unanimous that Xinhua cannot be trusted to cover them accurately and dispassionately; some editors favour outright deprecation because of its lack of [[WP:IS|editorial independence]]. There is no consensus for applying any one single label to the whole of the agency. Caution should be exercised in using this source, extremely so in case of [[WP:REDFLAG|extraordinary claims]] on controversial subjects or [[WP:BLP|biographies of living people]]. When in doubt, try to find better sources instead; use [[WP:INTEXT|inline attribution]] if you must use Xinhua.",
