As a result, the ''Daily Mail'' should not be used for determining notability, nor should it be used as a source in articles. The ''Daily Mail'' has a \"reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication\". The ''Daily Mail'' may be used in rare cases in an [[WP:ABOUTSELF|about-self fashion]]. Some editors regard the ''Daily Mail'' as reliable historically, so old articles may be used in a historical context. (Note that dailymail.co.uk is not trustworthy as a source of past content that was printed in the ''Daily Mail''.) The restriction is often incorrectly interpreted as a \"ban\" on the ''Daily Mail''. The deprecation includes other editions of the UK ''Daily Mail'', such as the Irish and Scottish editions.

Some editors have said that low-quality reporting also appeared in some preceding years, but a specific date after which the articles are considered generally unreliable has not been proposed. Previous consensus was that ''Rolling Stone'' was generally reliable for political and societal topics before 2011.

    summary = "Xinhua News Agency is the official state-run press agency of the People's Republic of China. There is consensus that Xinhua is generally reliable for factual reporting except in areas where the government of China may have a reason to use it for propaganda or disinformation. Xinhua is also generally reliable for the views and positions of the Chinese government and its officials. For subjects where the Chinese government may be a stakeholder, the consensus is almost unanimous that Xinhua cannot be trusted to cover them accurately and dispassionately; some editors favour outright deprecation because of its lack of [[WP:IS|editorial independence]]. There is no consensus for applying any one single label to the whole of the agency. Caution should be exercised in using this source, extremely so in case of [[WP:REDFLAG|extraordinary claims]] on controversial subjects or [[WP:BLP|biographies of living people]]. When in doubt, try to find better sources instead; use [[WP:INTEXT|inline attribution]] if you must use Xinhua."
